# Pokedex
Pokedex Android App
This is an Android app that acts as a Pokedex, created by Nahil Hind. It utilizes the PokApi API to display information about various Pokemon species.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and open it in Android Studio. You will need to create an account and obtain an API key from the PokApi website in order to access the data. Once you have obtained an API key, you will need to replace the placeholder value in the gradle.properties file with your actual API key.


Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nahilhind/Pokedex.git

Usage
Once you have set up the project, you can run it on an Android emulator or physical device. The app will allow you to search for a specific Pokemon by name, and it will display information about the Pokemon's type, abilities, moves, and evolutionary history. You can also view an image of the Pokemon and hear its cry.
